    If you thought Minimalism had a place only in art-house cinema, you clearly haven’t visited Minimal Bollywood Posters on Facebook- Copyright of Akshar Pathak.

    A carom board and a glass of orange juice for ‘Munna Bhai M.B.B.S’, and an extended forearm etched  with - ‘Mera Baap Chor Hai’ for Deewar. Simple, uncluttered and usually smile-inducing- Akshar’s posters use that one image a film leaves you with. Despite likes and comments galore on every poster of his, Akshar knows he has new worlds to conquer. He has moved on to Minimal Hollywood and Minimal TV Series as well.
