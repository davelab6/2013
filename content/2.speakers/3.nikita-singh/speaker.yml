bio: |
    Nikita Singh is the author of two books- Love @ Facebook and Accidentally in Love. Both of which were written in under two weeks, and went on to become super-hits. Through her literary endeavours, Nikita has managed to reconcile the oxymoron in ‘intelligent chick-lit’.

    In Nikita’s Utopia, she would be the author of fantasy fiction, and let her imagination run wild with vampires and witches.

    A self-confessed foodie on her Twitter profile, her tweets also reveal that she is a die-hard romantic.
