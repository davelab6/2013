bio: |
    Qaushik Mukherjee&rsquo;s film Gandu may never get past the Indian Censor Board. Yet, it went on to win him the Grand Jury Award for Best Director at the South Asia International Film Festival 2010, and his film the Narrative Feature: Jury Award.
    Gandu is the story of a frustrated teenager and his friendship with a riksha-walla, fascination with sex and experiments with drugs â€“ shot with a Canon 7D, and strung together with a Bangla rap soundtrack.  Call it a protest film, or the angst of talent that will never see the light - Gandu will definitely 'shock us out of this zombie television state', as Quashik puts it.
